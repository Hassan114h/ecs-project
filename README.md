This project demonstrates a fully functional deployment of **Gatus** on **AWS ECS Fargate**, following best practices for infrastructure, high availability, and automation. Key features include:

- **Terraform backend with S3**: central state storage, versioning for rollbacks, and encryption for security.
- **VPC Configuration**: 2 public subnets (one per AZ) for ALB and NAT Gateways, 2 private subnets (one per AZ) for ECS tasks.
- **ECR repository** for storing application images.
- **Route 53 hosted zone** with an alias record pointing to the ALB.
- **Automated CI/CD deployment**: infrastructure provisioned and updated reliably through GitHub Actions pipelines.

Provides a scalable, secure, and production-ready monitoring solution using Gatus.
